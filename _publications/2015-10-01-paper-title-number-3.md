* In this paper, the authors introduce integral stochastic orderings of a class of asymmetric distributions. This class of distributions extends from elliptical location-scale mixture distributions and includes many useful special cases.  
* The authors derive some necessary and sufficient conditions for comparing the random vectors from this class of distributions.
