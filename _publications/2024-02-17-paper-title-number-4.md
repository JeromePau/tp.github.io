* The characteristic function of matrix variate skew normal distribution is derived in this paper.
* The authors establish an identity for $Ef(Y)- Ef(X)$, where $X$ and $Y$ both have matrix variate skew-normal distributions. 
* The authors derive some necessary and sufficient conditions for the comparison of matrix variate skew-normal distributions under several stochastic orders.
