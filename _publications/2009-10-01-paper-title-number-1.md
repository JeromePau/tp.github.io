* This paper proposes another new type of systemic risk measure, called the joint marginal expected shortfall (JMES), to measure whether the MES of one entity's risk-taking adds to another one or the overall risk conditioned on the event that the entity is already in some specified distress level.  
* The authors further provide some numerical examples to illustrate our main findings. A real application in analyzing the risk contagion among several stock market indices is implemented to show the performances of our proposed measures.
